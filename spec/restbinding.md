This section defines how the generic operations and responses from Section 7 are realized over HTTP using RESTful conventions. It specifies the HTTP methods, request formats, and status codes that an[LWS REST Servers](https://w3c.github.io/lws-protocol/spec/#dfn-lws-rest-server) and [LWS REST Clients](https://w3c.github.io/lws-protocol/spec/#dfn-lws-rest-client) should use for interoperability. In other words, itâ€™s a concrete mapping of the abstract operations to HTTP requests and responses. The following assumes an LWS server exposing resources via HTTP URIs, and an LWS client using HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, etc.) to invoke the operations.

For each core operation (create, read, update, delete), we describe the HTTP method(s) to use, required headers or special considerations, and what the server should do and return. Standard HTTP status codes are used to indicate outcomes (success or various errors), following the semantics outlined in Section 7\. The binding tries to adhere to HTTP/1.1 and relevant RFCs (such as \[[RFC 7231](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7231)\] for HTTP semantics, \[[RFC 7233](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7233)\] for range requests, \[[RFC 5789](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5789.html)\] for PATCH, etc.) so that it integrates naturally with web standards.

**Note:** Examples given in this section (HTTP request and response snippets) are **non-normative**, meant to illustrate typical usage. The actual requirements are stated in the descriptive text and tables. Also, while this binding covers HTTP (as the initial target protocol), the LWS operations could in principle be bound to other protocols in the future.
