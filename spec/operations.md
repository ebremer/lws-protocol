This section defines the four core operations that a Linked Web Storage (LWS) server **MUST** support.  These operations manipulate resources and containers in a transport-independent manner, focusing on semantics rather than implementation details.  Each operation specifies inputs, expected behaviors, and possible responses (outcomes).  Responses include success indicators, resource representations (where applicable), and error conditions.  Implementations **MUST** handle these operations atomically and consistently, meaning each operation either succeeds completely or fails without partial side effects.  In case of errors, responses **SHOULD** provide enough detail for agents to understand the issue (e.g., an error code and message) without leaking sensitive information.  All normative requirements (e.g., MUST, SHOULD, MAY) are to be interpreted as in \[[RFC 2119](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119)\].
